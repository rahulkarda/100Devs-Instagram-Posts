[TagEmbed API](https://tagembed.com/support/api-documentation/) lets you create beautiful social hubs for your websites with a click of a button.

Our API solutions give you absolute control of the design and layout of the content for your websites or screen displays. This is the best way to integrate the tagembed data on your apps. Find below documentation for the same.

## Optimizations
While improve this project, I would start by implementing the following features -

   1. <s>Making it mobile responsive</s>
   2. Adding a loading bar/circle 
   3. Adding dark theme posts
   
              
## Lessons Learned
I learned about the basics of API and how they can be used asynchronously to fetch data without blocking the rest of the functionalities. I learned how to integrate Twitter's API and use it to fetch the tweets. I learned about API management and how the API serves a request and how can it help in improving businesses.
